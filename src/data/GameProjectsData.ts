    You are the first person to pick a buggy mess of a game in a very long time, and things don't seem to work as expected. The only hope for this game to work is if you team up with a weirdly incompetent AI to fix the game from within.

        For the virtual reality course at Instituto Superior Técnico, me and my colleagues developed a puzzle-like game.
        Our intention was to explore communication techniques between a user in a virtual reality space and another user in a tablet, 2 different type of interaction mediums.

        A rogue-like game where to attack, you need to draw spells! Explore the randomly generated dungeon, grab loot and defeat enemies with fire balls and the like!
